# Heart-rate-prediction-
Heart failure is a common event caused by Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and this
dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People
with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of
one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already
established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning
model can be of great help.

There are various classification algorithms present out of which I shall implement the following:
● Decision Tree Classifier
● Gaussian Naive Bayes
● K-Mean Clustering
● Neural Networks: MLP
● Random Forest
● XGBoost Classifier

You can see results in our Report.pdf

Happy Coding!!
